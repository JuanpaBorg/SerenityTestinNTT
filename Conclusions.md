## Exercise Conclusions

### Exercise Description

In this exercise, an automated end-to-end (E2E) functional test was performed on the purchase flow on the [OpenCart](http://opencart.abstracta.us/) website. The test included the following steps:

1. Adding two products to the cart.
2. Viewing the cart.
3. Completing the checkout process as a guest.
4. Finalizing the purchase until the confirmation message: "Your order has been placed!"

### Conclusions

1. **Coverage of Critical Scenarios:**
   - The test covered one critical scenario of the purchase flow, ensuring that users can add products to the cart and complete the purchase without issues.
   
2. **Functionality Verification:**
   - It was verified that the system allows for a guest checkout, which is essential for users who do not wish to register.
   - The final confirmation of "Your order has been placed!" ensures that the entire flow was completed successfully.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Error and Exception Handling:**
   - Enhance error and exception handling during the purchase flow, such as edge cases like duplicating the tab and verify if this records reflecting the sale are updated accordingly.
   
2. **Additional Validations:**
   - Include additional validations at each step of the flow to ensure that all necessary elements are present and visible, such as correct prices in the cart and order details on the confirmation page.

### Variations and Out-of-the-Box Thinking

1. **Cross-Browser and Device Testing:**
   - Execute tests across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience across all platforms.
   
2. **Different Payment Methods:**
   - Include variations in the payment methods used during checkout to cover different scenarios that users may encounter.
   
3. **Simulating Concurrent Users:**
   - Simulate multiple users making purchases simultaneously to verify how the system handles traffic and ensure no bottlenecks occur.

4. **Internationalization Testing:**
   - Conduct tests with different regional and language settings to ensure the site is accessible and functional for users from different countries.
   
5. **Integration with External Systems:**
   - Test integration with external systems such as payment gateways and shipping services to ensure the complete purchase experience, from product selection to delivery, is smooth.

### Final Conclusion

Conducting this automated E2E test provided a thorough and robust verification of the purchase flow on the OpenCart website. The proposed improvements and variations aim to ensure a more secure, faster, and reliable shopping experience for all users, regardless of their location, device, or preferred payment method.
